Update help page as needed
Wrap in electron and turn into a .exe file

If unable to analyse/scrape add reason to Process Status box on dashboard
x In prompt page when clicking the file dropdown, updates in real time and scans for new files.

The Active LLM Model should display a default message if the analyse has already been completed before instead of just saying 'detecting active model' 
Add the ability to send multiple batches in parallel (add a var to config to control how many are sent in one hit)
