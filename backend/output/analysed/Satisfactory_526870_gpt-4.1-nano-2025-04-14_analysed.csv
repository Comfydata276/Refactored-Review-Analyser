199306236,english,"Certified Alien Burger Game.

On a large distant planet you start off small and build simple constructions, and then come to realise you can always expand and redo what you made into something even better. Crap, you think to yourself, and built it again. Hell you might end up like me and start learning about actual factory building because it's intriguing how you can almost always improve the factory that at one point thought was the bomb. But the neat part is that when you need a break from min-maxing your creations you can explore and kill these little pesky aliens while gathering buffs for the factory, or build a giant highway for your trucks, or improve the pen of your lizard dogs, or make a 1:1 scale of your childhood jungle gym for the alien spiders in a dark cave... uhh..
Anyways it gets surprisingly fun to adventure out on the planet simply because the hand-crafted map is both pretty and interesting enough to want to discover. The final piece of why this game is easy to sperg out to is that the sandbox settings and modding can mould the game into exactly what you want out of a factory game. I've personally gotten a lot of mileage from both a jump/sprint & a hook mod that makes travelling super fun. The story however is quite ass and hasn't improved much since Early Access but who cares when the charm of everything else makes Satisfactory so goddamn fun to progress.

Everything feels solid and smooth. The building system is smart and gives you the freedom to plan things the way you want. It feels really good to see things working exactly how you imagined. Sometimes it takes a while to figure out how to connect everything in the most efficient way, but that process is part of the fun.

The sound design and music are also great. They help create the right atmosphere while you work on your next big project. Even when I am just standing still and looking at everything I built, it feels rewarding.
