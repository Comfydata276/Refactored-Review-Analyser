So a lot the issues I had with the first game is improved upon but overall the game feels very much the same to me as the first game but not in a bad way, Fallout 2 feels as if it should've been the first entry of the franchise and as you can see a lot of the assets from the first game are reused which makes sense considering Fallout 2 only came out a year later. The intro for this game hits harder for me considering ending of it sets the tone for the game pretty well and the pay off by the end of the game itself is very pleasing in my opinion.

Thoroughly enjoyed this game as much as Fallout 1, only real complaint is the movement on the grid this game seems to be restrained whereas in Fallout 1 you could be on one end of the map and point then click the other end to send MC that way, long as there isn't anything in their path that is, but in Fallout 2 it seems you're only allowed a specific number of tiles you can travel on the grid at a time which becomes annoying in bigger settlements/cities.
