So a lot the issues I had with the first game is improved upon but overall the game feels very much the same to me as the first game but not in a bad way, Fallout 2 feels as if it should've been the first entry of the franchise and as you can see a lot of the assets from the first game are reused which makes sense considering Fallout 2 only came out a year later. The intro for this game hits harder for me considering ending of it sets the tone for the game pretty well and the pay off by the end of the game itself is very pleasing in my opinion.

Thoroughly enjoyed this game as much as Fallout 1, only real complaint is the movement on the grid this game seems to be restrained whereas in Fallout 1 you could be on one end of the map and point then click the other end to send MC that way, long as there isn't anything in their path that is, but in Fallout 2 it seems you're only allowed a specific number of tiles you can travel on the grid at a time which becomes annoying in bigger settlements/cities.

The end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted. Too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless, the reasons, as always, purely human ones.

The earth was nearly wiped clean of life. A great cleansing, an atomic spark struck by human hands, quickly raged out of control. Spears of nuclear fire rained from the skies. Continents were swallowed in flames and fell beneath the boiling oceans. Humanity was almost extinguished, their spirits becoming part of the background radiation that blanketed the earth.

A quiet darkness fell across the planet, lasting many years. Few survived the devastation. Some had been fortunate enough to reach safety, taking shelter in great underground vaults. When the great darkness passed, these vaults opened, and their inhabitants emerged to begin their lives again.

One of the northern tribes claims they are descended from one such Vault. They hold that their founder and ancestor, one known as the ""Vault Dweller,"" once saved the world from a great evil. According to their legend, this evil arose in the far south. It corrupted all it touched, twisting men inside, turning them into beasts. Only through the bravery of this Vault Dweller was the evil destroyed. But in so doing, he lost many of his friends and suffered greatly, sacrificing much of himself to save the world.

When at last he returned to the home he had fought so hard to protect, he was cast out. Exiled. In confronting that which they feared, he had become something else in their eyes...and no longer their champion.

Forsaken by his people, he strode into the wasteland. He traveled far to the north, until he came to the great canyons. There, he founded a small village, Arroyo, where he lived out the rest of his years. And so, for a generation since its founding, Arroyo has lived in peace, its canyons sheltering it from the outside world. It is home. Your home.

Fallout 2 remains one of the finest examples of what an RPG can achieve when it prioritizes player agency and world-building over hand-holding. This is a game that respects your intelligence while simultaneously mocking your every failure.

[h2]The Good[/h2]

[b]Immersive RPG Systems:[/b] The character creation and progression systems are heavily inspired by GURPS, creating a depth that modern RPGs rarely match. Every stat point matters, every skill choice has consequences, and your character build fundamentally changes how you experience the world.

[b]Consequences That Matter:[/b] This game doesn't pull punches. I once failed a timed quest and watched an entire peaceful community get annihilated because I didn't track the time properly. The guilt was real, and that's exactly what makes this game special.

[b]Dark Humor Done Right:[/b] The world has a wicked sense of humor. NPCs call me ""Virgin of the Wastes,"" rats literally know my name and flee in terror, and yes—you can deal with those insufferably annoying children in ways that would make modern game developers faint.

[b]Environmental Storytelling:[/b] I once dug up an entire town looking for a necklace. The fact that this is not only possible but makes perfect sense in context shows the game's commitment to player freedom. Oh, and ghosts are real—because of course they are.

[h2]The Not-So-Good[/h2]

[b]Technical Issues:[/b] Let's be honest—this game has bugs. Lots of them. Some sections are downright broken, and the pixel-perfect precision required for certain interactions can be maddening.

[b]Quality of Life:[/b] The interface hasn't aged gracefully, and some mechanics that felt clever in 1998 now feel needlessly obtuse.

[h2]Essential Recommendation[/h2]

[b][u]Install the Restoration Project immediately.[/u][/b] It's not optional—it's mandatory. This mod fixes the vast majority of bugs and restores cut content that makes the experience significantly better.

[hr][/hr]

Fallout 2 is a game that trusts you to be an adult. It doesn't apologize for its complexity, doesn't hold your hand through moral dilemmas, and doesn't care if you make mistakes that haunt you for the rest of your playthrough. It's brutally honest about the post-apocalyptic world it presents, and in return, it offers one of the most rewarding RPG experiences ever created.

Like many of you out there, I believe I picked this up for a couple dollars way back as a bundle with Fallout and Fallout Tactics. Since then, it has sat in my library until I just recently decided to play it. Damn this game is good! Of those early titles from Black Isle Studios, Fallout 2 is definitely the best. But Steam was not the first time I met with this titan of role playing games. I remember going to the media section of Target when I was a kid and picking up the case for this game (also bundled with Fallout and Tactics) off the shelf. Maybe I was playing the just released Fallout 3 or maybe I was simply drawn to the bug eyes of the Enclave soldier on the front, but I bought it and quickly stuck the CD ROM in the family computer running Windows XP.  The rest is, forgive the cliché, history. Holy smokes did I get sucked into this game. Funny, considering I wasn't even really that good at it. I was scouring GameFAQs for all the hints and advice I could get. But eventually, after creating a 10 Agility character and getting more comfortable with combat, I could just wander on my own and appreciate the immersive world of post-apocalyptic California. I'm looking forward to accessing some of that childlike wonder whenever I don't have to worry about adult things. If, for whatever reason, you have not given this game a go yet, you should try it. It will be worth your time. Now, the game ships with SFall, a big engine tweak, as well as the High Res patch, which it makes it look much better than it did on, say, an old Windows XP machine.

game that made a example for years
deserving it's own remaster (NOT REMAKE okay maybe exept making gui more clear) instead of fallout 3 which is crap compared to F2
it can be quite difficult to get through at frist, but when you will get used to turn based combat and gui (instructions button is under f1 xddd) everything will be fine
also you should play fallout 1 frist, it's shorter, easier, more welcoming, but it's technically same game
fallout 2 is huge, is full of content compared to many modern games
and most WOKE oldschool game you will probabbly see haha
still it is old and it is game from 1999, and it looks like one from this year",1750332950,1750332950,True,7,1,0.565650641918182373,0,True,False,False,False,76561199680855606,30,4,4550,0,4536,1752170118,
