Everything feels solid and smooth. The building system is smart and gives you the freedom to plan things the way you want. It feels really good to see things working exactly how you imagined. Sometimes it takes a while to figure out how to connect everything in the most efficient way, but that process is part of the fun.

The sound design and music are also great. They help create the right atmosphere while you work on your next big project. Even when I am just standing still and looking at everything I built, it feels rewarding.

I keep coming back to this game because there is always something new I want to try. A new layout. A better power system. A new goal to reach. It keeps me thinking and planning even when I am not playing.
