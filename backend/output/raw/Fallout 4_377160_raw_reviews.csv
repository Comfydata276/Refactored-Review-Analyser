So the upsides in context of previous fallout games: The engine is much better and smoother than the one in previous 3D fallout games.  That's pretty much it.

Negatives: The world makes no sense and is considerably dumber than in previous fallout games, even compared to FO3. There is zero role play, you get to choose some stats but at the end of day, you'll just go from a to b to shoot stuff. The plot is incredibly boring, linear and poorly written.

All DLC's except High Resolution Texture Pack will softlock your game if you do any of them before finishing story mode or side quests.
If they do not softlock your game which happened in all of my 3 playthroughs they will make your main game story quests or side quests collide with DLC quests making them overlap and disable certain choices you can make in that DLC or kill characters you can save. *This isn't supposed to happen by disable I mean glitch out

Massive amount of overlapping textures

Non-stopping crashes.

Saves can be easily corrupted.

Do not ever install any free add-ons from the Store, Servers litteraly don't work they will either delete all of the items that have that modifications or corrupt your game file.

Stealing a power armor from a dead enemy will immediately make any settlement hostile towards you even though it's yours don't ever use a looted power armor near a settlement.

Dogmeat and all other companions have terrible AI always hitting walls or invisible walls and always getting stuck at doors and making your movement impossible. In some missions there isn't an option to talk to your companions meaning if your companion gets stuck in a small room with you while it's near the door will litteraly softlock the game since there is no way to trigger the companion follow or command it to go anywhere else.

Terrible combat gameplay experience if you have no previous experience playing this game you will fight your own faction at least 17 times while doing side missions. This is side missions not main faction missions game will eventually make you betray a faction(s) if you mention those there is at least 40+ MAIN not side missions in which you litteraly fight the faction you are allied with again.

The swimming physics and animations look like they were exported from a free unity project.

After re-playing FO3 recently, this game feels absurdly easy. Caps in every single nook and cranny of the wastela-Commonwealth, med supplies everywhere, and every single object being expendable for supplies ironically takes the fun out of exploring. There's never really a feeling of satisfaction when you go through a building or a long quest, because you inevitably come out 10x richer and heavier than when you went in. 

Every time I was blown away by the graphics, I would look in another direction at a cartoon-y npc or have to engage in a weirdly cinematic & grandiose conversation.

In addition FO 4 is very easy to mod even for a beginner and you can basically modify the game to your liking, the possibilities are endless. There is some Jank here and there but nothing game-ruining.

Even with my currently around 20 mods the game is very stable, so far I did not encounter any crashes or game-breaking bugs (not even minor bugs to be honest).

All in all the game is a big recommendation for everyone who likes Loot, exploring and an atmopsheric post-apocalyptic open world in which there are many things to do but you are not forced to do any of them if you don't like (unlike the more story-driven RPGs like RDR2, KCD2 or CP77 for comparison).

TLDR: 

- Main Storyline: pretty mid ngl, like, most generic, run-of-the-mill narrative.

- Side Stories: Abundant, rewarding to complete due to varied loot BUT, redundant they get. They usually are fetch quest followed by escorting whomever or clear X place.

- Game Mechanics: As with each new Fallout game that comes out, they get better and better. HOWEVER, beth vibe coders sure do be vibing when they writing cause if you mess with the internal values of, lets say the field of view; BOY the game can become wonky/do 1+1=3 or 1+1=0 type stuff (relatable tbh, like I'm it fr *_*)

- Graphics: Love them, especially the lighting.

- Game Physics: can be summed up by ""Great in general, served with a side of Jank, *Bethesda Jank*™""

- Fun to be had: Much.

For the most part of my 225 hours of experience with the game I was not affected by that many issues like bugs or crashes, but for whatever reason in the last 20 or so hours I spent finishing the final dlc in my playthrough, I faced every bug and glitch that has been the game since the launch of the dlc in 2016. This absolutely ruined my experienced at the end of my playthrough. I am writing this review after a few months to look at the game in general from a fairer perspective which is why I have recommended it in the first place.

Fallout 4 innovates from the previous titles in terms of its gun play and combat getting major overhaul with guns that have a punch to them and unique weapons that are wacky but actually useful. The perks and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats getting an overhaul with how skill checks work provided more ways to build a character to your liking. While all this is improved upon, the story of the main game takes a major toll with no longer having serious consequences, basically just oversimplifying some of the major rpg elements that the previous games in the series where able to provide.

One thing that I would like to address about the game is it tries to do so many things and ends up making those things annoying to say the least. The settlement system is a good example of this as at first look it looks overly detailed and well thought out but the longer you spend trying to work with it, you will see all its issues. Because of the game’s original release on older gen system and their lower specs there is a limitation on how many items you can build in a settlement these include farm and beds like essentials and all the non-essential decor items. Even though the game’s had a next gen patch and have been released on newer consoles it still has this limit when the newer hardware is being capable of easily rendering much more items. If want to build a good-looking settlement what you will do is often use the item deletion glitch in the settlement to go over the limit of placeable objects. Another example is the loading screens, every time you go inside a building with a door or fast travel you sit at a loading screen for 4-5 seconds. And yes, it is regardless of how modern or strong your rig is you will have to wait for loading screen. It was the same for Fallout 3 & New Vegas but at least in those if you were playing on a modern system the load screen was instant. This sounds like a minor nitpick but these load screens will add up over the course of your playthrough whether you play for 10 hours or 100 hours.

On my final word about the game is it doesn’t always work the way that it’s supposed to but the bugs & glitches sure do. Then why do I recommend it, all the criticisms that I give the game is because of how good the game can be if Bethesda actually tests these systems instead of spending their time in the creation club. While I don’t touch on the store too much in this review as this was one of the older game releases thus the creation club items are just mediocre cosmetics and two or three overpowered weapon packs from Doom & Skyrim, which are not needed to play the game unlike 76. A normal player that just plays the quests and dlc is not going to find the experience of Fallout 4 bad. I played over 200 hours exploring most if not all of the main story and dlc map locations marked or unmarked without doing any glitches and thus stumbled on all the places that the game falls short or tries to do a lot and end up achieving very little. If you are fine with an okayish Bethesda rpg set in a fallout setting you can give this game a try.",1753791061,1753791061,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,76561198811172166,480,18,13555,0,13555,1740513779,

- Gameplay can be good
- Characters are extremelly well written and acted
- Some aspects of the HISTORY are BAD, and it undermines the journey
- Id hated most of the game's guns designs
- Fun exploration / big open-world

After hours of troubleshooting and messing with graphics, the game started running well and the gameplay really delivers. Part of me wonders if the game is so poorly optimized to inflate hours but the game have so much content that i almost sure its partial incompetence.

This games really shines on it's ""gamplay-loop"". If you like collecting trash like a goblin this is perfect for it. You collect stuff to build and craft but it's not like the other girls, this one good.

Without spoiling much the game have a pretty bad and unsatisfying final act and conclusion. The setting, the world-build and the atmosphere do the heavy lifting, but these aspects of the written story will highly drag down the whole experience.[spoiler]The whole end-faction mystery are played too simple and under-explained that it comes out as pure lazyness and incompetence.[/spoiler] It's not everything is bad, the characters are awesome, even after years after playing i can remember all companions names, and the start/middle of the journey is decent.

200862771,english,"Addiction, that's the only was to describe it, 100 hours in the first week and well. you can see on this review that I didn't stop, I'm just now touching into mods and the modding community is amazing, the support is wonderful and it's easier to figure out than other games in this series, there is crashing but it's not that bad *unless* you play survival where you can only save by sleeping, I ended up downloading an autosave mod which I really didn't want to have to do, but after losing a few hours of progress I caved.

But don't let that discourage you, crashes are few and far between and expected from a game of this age and complexity, however it can be annoying when it does happen, from what i understand most players don't play survival so you'll likely be fine, but I'm a sucker for punishment as I play exclusively survival.

the DLC's are not that bad all things consider, Nuka-World is worse for wear when you realize that the leather armor is better than Marine armor, it seems they just made nuka world then added +20 to everything as a base stat across the board, making the park a harder place and a nice challenge over all. However it can feel very lazy to just add higher hp pools as a challenge.

Far Harbor is lovely if you are into lore and immersion, being a detective and figuring this out is amazing, especially if you turn off quest markers so you actually have to figure things out on your own-some. 

As for the other DLC, it has issues here and there, but in the end I feel like I got what I paid for, it's not great, but it adds enough that it felt fair.


If you are looking to start the Fallout Series, start here, do not start on 76, 3, or New Vegas. I can't speak for 1 or 2. However this is where you want to start. I hear people complain about their game getting bricked from the ""Next-Gen"" update, which I agree that update sucks so bad, but I haven't had any issues, that being said I downloaded the game after said update, and if your reading this, so will you. 

Something frustrating about the next gen update is there are some soldiers you can find in power armor at level 1, as fast as you want, it's the best armor in the entire game, this makes building up and fixing the starting armor and all armor after that you find feel worthless.",1753643834,1753644032,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,False,76561199777782771,0,4,17192,7088,14581,1754103942,

200853118,english,"Depends on mods to make it good. It may be fun, but isn't a good Fallout game. 

Bethesda destroyed the art style of the gritty, undefined wastes, trading it in for cartoon-y, inaccurate, rounded and simplified mess of a AAA game. The 50's environment isn't what it's supposed to be. It was to be retro-futuristic, gritty, destroyed towns, cities, etc. The visuals are nice but they are just too bright and flashy, unlike the raw and gritty visuals of the earlier games.

Bethesda fucked up on the design of guns and enemies. Majority of the guns look like toys and hunks of messes, instead of actual guns. (I'm not counting energy weapons because... well yeah.) The super-mutants now look like skinny Shrek-like guys instead of beasts that were strengthened by the F.E.V., Ghouls now look a lot more ""cutesy"" and simplified, and Deathclaws are no longer terrifying. They're just big hostile lizards. 

Gameplay wise, it's a disaster. Yes, I know Bethesda was trying to open up to a new audience, but it betrays the original Fallouts in so many ways. Dialogue is shit, ambiguity of your character is gone due to them being voiced and having a very tight backstory, the RPG elements are watered down and diluted to the point where the tasty sodas of the Fallout games before, are now what remains after the ice melts in the soda, a watery mess.

Variety is odd. There isn't much variety between the factions, being that some factions are just guards for Diamond City. They completely scrapped the ammo variants and skills. It's only perks now. No more using points to fill up your speech, lockpick, medicine, etc. 

Story sucks. It may have some thrilling side quests and some small interesting plot points, but it's just so hollow. There's not much complexity to it.

Look, Fallout 4 is a kind of fun game, but it isn't a Fallout game. Bethesda mischaracterized what made Fallout well- Fallout, and made others mischaracterize the franchise.The gameplay itself keeps itself together with duct tape and glue, then calls it a day. I think it's enjoyable but it betrays Fallout in so many ways.  I liked the Power Armor system tho.

This game is a comfortable 2nd place on the favorite-games-heavily-lenient-on-nostalgia-also-released-by-Bethesda List. This game is rich with lore, its neck and neck with Elder Scrolls for me. Gameplay is amazing, best Gun Combat out of any fallout entry. I love the Physics and Character movement of this game, its so fluid and intuitive. Story Wise, like where you yourself go/do, is all right. The broader lore and story at large however is fantastic, and thats What I care about most in this game. The Alternative-History Genre is one of my favorites in any media, and Fallout to me is the Poster boy of that. The ultimate end of humanity, A nuclear wasteland filled with other Sci-Fi elements that are clearly fiction, but you can visualize how they could of become reality had our scientists and political leaders make different decisions. Its a Mockery of the Modern Hyper-Militarized, Pro War Sentiment that we all confide to everyday. One day, society will destroy itself, but Humanity will still be standing.

200461631,english,"For context, I have attempted to complete this game four times in total. I would usually get five hours in before getting bored out of my mind and uninstalling. However, as time went by I became more patient and were more willing to put up with inconveniences such as loading screens or walking simulators (sometimes the game would leave you loading for up to four minutes and it surprised me the first time because I was sure the game had crashed).

I started getting more enjoyment when I changed my play-style so that rather then leveling by clearing out random locations, I chose to listen to each character's dialogue so that I get more attached and involved in the story, and as a bonus, completing quests are rewarded with XP.

I didn't play through the game all in one blast, I would switch between games just playing whatever was more interesting at the moment and I eventually got to the end of this one. You just gotta learn to ignore some side quests and mix up the monotony of gameplay with a main story line quest.

In all honesty though, the very ending of the game gave me a sour taste in my mouth because it just ends, the game didn't give me any closure that I made ""right"" or ""wrong"" decisions in gameplay because it just leaves me to figure that out myself. The only thing you get is if you go around the various towns you can hear the casual dialogue of characters reacting to the changes that were made, but it is still extremely underwhelming.

The FPS aspect is fun and well done. It's a different kind of game from say Call of Duty or any of the other popular FPS games. It's not online or competitive. You're playing through a story contained within a fairly open world. It can be fast paced and epic, or as slow and stealthy as you want, depending on your play style.

It has a nice ""builders"" function where you're able to upgrade weapons and armor, and probably should just to maintain an edge in combat. There is a neat settlement feature which I've always enjoyed building within. It even has a ""time stop"" feature that gives combat a bit more of a ""turn-based"" feel, which can be fun though I rarely utilize it. I enjoy the run-n-gun.

What has me coming back time and time again is the story. I've explored most-all of the various branches, but I still enjoy running through my favorite story branch now and then, even if it's not exactly canon. So it has it's own ""cyoa"" aspect.

Fallout 4 was my first Fallout game. I still remember watching H20 Delirious play all those years ago. 

So far, gunplay feels fun and fresh, the dialogue is good enough and pretty enjoyable, building settlements has become an addiction, I have become a sociopath in conversations, and it could just be me but it appears another settlement needs my help. 

I started with vanilla plus modded taking into account the age of the game (mostly mods for QoL and preventing crashing/aiding stability) and I loved it so much. PC bricked before I could fully explore all the side quests but man am I going to copy back my save once I get a replacement. It is a game that has aged very well and will continue to age so. Definitely recommend the game if you're looking to play a Fallout game and love the retro Atompunk post wasteland aesthetic.

Will definitely also try out Fallout 3 and New Vegas at some point considering how fun playing this one was!",1753253633,1753253750,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,False,76561198271226655,74,2,6045,0,6045,1717598696,

200315019,english,"I cannot remember the state of the game when I played it originally, back in early 2016. I used mods and stuck with the Institute, but never bothered to finish the achievements. Flash forward to now, and I am not sure if the game has improved. 

This playthrough was based on the un-modded version of the game. The loading times range from a couple of seconds to nearly a minute, and with everything being isolated in their own areas, you are going to be seeing those loading screens often. It kills the flow of the game considerably and starts to become more noticeable. Path-finding can be incredibly frustrating with NPCs just standing still after being activated for a quest or taking forever to start moving after hitting the corner of a door, as if the programming is struggling to compensate. Thankfully, I had only three cases where I needed load a safe to retry the section to get them to move, but the amount of downtime this creates is beyond irritating. Then there is the wonkiness of your own movement, whether in a suit of power armor or standard. You could be moving forward, then suddenly the locomotion shifts to the side and no amount of course correction can eliminate the drifting sensation. There are even times the character will just randomly strafe from side to side when you are trying to make a turn or backing up. I cannot remember the last time I experienced this in a game. Then you have the way dialog tracking is cut off when you initially start dialog, which makes it difficult to skip it without risking accidentally shooting your weapon into them and requiring a reload. It is bad enough NPCs will start talking to you without a prompt and trap you in a dialog choice screen when all you were doing was trying to sit down or wait for a NPC to finish walking to your location.

There are a slew of bugs ranging from items not spawning properly, enemies disappearing into the terrain, objectives not updating properly, and doors leading to a new area not working properly. Thankfully the game ran better than I expected with consistent frame rates, but there are times the game did crash (only a few times).

This is more of a case of justifying the experience. With how much the system struggles and the amount of time you are forced to wait for subpar combat and the blatant settlement padding, I just can't recommend it. If the story and side content was better (subjective), but even with the two major DLCs being fresh content for me, it really left little in the way of any lasting impression. The Far Harbor was too bogged down by further synth arguments and the Nuka World content had very little in the way of character development (also bogged down by more settlement padding). Some of the companions are great, but the majority felt very flat-line, and the heavy focus on synths can be a huge turn off (depends on your stance on empathy toward machines and the lack of tension due to how they are handled in the setting). 

I just can't recommend it for the technical issues. If you think the story will be interesting, only grab it on a steep sale (which happens often enough), but realize there can be a lot of downtime between action.

P.S. If you are just after the achievements, be prepared for an annoying grind for the tickets at the Nuka-cade (unless you use the console commands, but no clue if that voids achievements)",1753117647,1753117647,False,2,0,0.526524603366851807,0,True,False,False,False,76561198000561257,0,9,9292,1563,9292,1753111937,
