The (player) models are also somehow worse than Skyrim... load times are also insanely long - Skyrim with 150+ mods loads faster than vanilla FO4 (same drive - honestly not sure what FO4 is taking so long to render...) 

I wish it were a better New Vegas or a Skyrim with guns - but it fails to be either: the world isn't as intriguing as New Vegas and the gameplay is nowhere near as smooth/accurate as Skyrim (which had its own issues, but it still feels better). 

Gun play is okay - same as New Vegas, maybe a bit better. But there are still some UI glitches in Fullscreen mode that can lead to shooting where your crosshair isn't pointing. 

It's decent, if you're into Fallout it's better than 76. But New Vegas remains unmatched in terms of atmosphere, story, and world.

201482338,english,"I would say I've had fun with this game, story was a little weak here or there but generally the gameplay was pretty good (except minutemen faction's gameplay). Also the game is VERY modable (nexus mods is where to get all the good stuff).

The base game story had interesting aspects to it but sometimes suffered from poor writing (example being the institute wanting to help the commonwealth yet released super mutants into the commonwealth and father stepping outside for the first time and just saying the the commonwealth is beyond saving). 

Nuka World: Weak gameplay (mostly go to attraction plant raider gang flag), theme was cool I just wish gameplay was better.

Fah Habah (Far Harbor): Generally really good, reminded me of point lookout in fallout 3. Spooky atmosphere, with a very morally challenging choice for the main quest. I honestly thought this DLC was really good.

The others: The other DLC's prioritized settlement building over actual story which kinda sucks in my opinion.

Automatron: Short little side quest, allowed for the creation of silly robots like my creation ""Princess"" and ""Clanka""

Vault-tec workshop: You get to build a vault and do ethically questionable experiments (wow....)

The other ones: IDK probably just settlement building stuff

Creation club: Cool except for the fact they are essentially paid-for mods, some are free like Enclave Remnants which is okay in my opinion.

I'd say generally the gameplay is good, and the mods that you can get make this game worth getting and playing I just wish the story was a bit more refined and DLCs more story oriented (building is fun, but story is more important in a fallout game, look at the DLCs for New Vegas or even Fallout 3 compared to the ones in this game, I'd say the older ones were more interesting). I don't hate building but I find the story of Fallout games to be more interesting. Again you can get this game (G.O.T.Y edition) for cheap in 2025, and it is very fun (but definitely get mods to enhance the experience, and remember when installing mods be careful and don't be afraid to watch guides / mod reviews to help install them.

I have to close out Steam and restart the game. Also, the dialogue trees are pointless and annoying. Those are my negatives. Other than those shortcomings the game is incredible.

Its issues are many and well known. Lackluster main plot, classic Bethesda jank, questionable modelling.
But I don't care (much). This is the game that made me a Fallout fan. I simply couldn't get into FO3 or NV, not for lack of trying. Something about this one hit that sweet spot. I love the settlement building system. I love being able to use the junk you pick up, the detritus of the ruined past, to modify your weapons and armor, build turrets and electrical grids. This was a stroke of genius. I really get a sense of accomplishment having top-of-the-line gear and settlements that could rival Diamond City just by breaking down and using the stuff I grab in unrestrained looting.
Also the music. I love the music. I like the oldies playing on the radio, of course, but I love the game soundtrack itself. It's so haunting, like a lament for what was lost, but also with a little twinge of optimism for the future. Maybe you can make a difference. Maybe the tide can be turned.

So the upsides in context of previous fallout games: The engine is much better and smoother than the one in previous 3D fallout games.  That's pretty much it.

Negatives: The world makes no sense and is considerably dumber than in previous fallout games, even compared to FO3. There is zero role play, you get to choose some stats but at the end of day, you'll just go from a to b to shoot stuff. The plot is incredibly boring, linear and poorly written.

All DLC's except High Resolution Texture Pack will softlock your game if you do any of them before finishing story mode or side quests.
If they do not softlock your game which happened in all of my 3 playthroughs they will make your main game story quests or side quests collide with DLC quests making them overlap and disable certain choices you can make in that DLC or kill characters you can save. *This isn't supposed to happen by disable I mean glitch out

Massive amount of overlapping textures

Non-stopping crashes.

Saves can be easily corrupted.

Do not ever install any free add-ons from the Store, Servers litteraly don't work they will either delete all of the items that have that modifications or corrupt your game file.

Stealing a power armor from a dead enemy will immediately make any settlement hostile towards you even though it's yours don't ever use a looted power armor near a settlement.

Dogmeat and all other companions have terrible AI always hitting walls or invisible walls and always getting stuck at doors and making your movement impossible. In some missions there isn't an option to talk to your companions meaning if your companion gets stuck in a small room with you while it's near the door will litteraly softlock the game since there is no way to trigger the companion follow or command it to go anywhere else.

Terrible combat gameplay experience if you have no previous experience playing this game you will fight your own faction at least 17 times while doing side missions. This is side missions not main faction missions game will eventually make you betray a faction(s) if you mention those there is at least 40+ MAIN not side missions in which you litteraly fight the faction you are allied with again.

The swimming physics and animations look like they were exported from a free unity project.

After re-playing FO3 recently, this game feels absurdly easy. Caps in every single nook and cranny of the wastela-Commonwealth, med supplies everywhere, and every single object being expendable for supplies ironically takes the fun out of exploring. There's never really a feeling of satisfaction when you go through a building or a long quest, because you inevitably come out 10x richer and heavier than when you went in. 

Every time I was blown away by the graphics, I would look in another direction at a cartoon-y npc or have to engage in a weirdly cinematic & grandiose conversation. I guess my expectations were a lot higher coming back to this game, and though I will continue to replay it, the motivation is quickly diminishing.

TLDR: 

- Main Storyline: pretty mid ngl, like, most generic, run-of-the-mill narrative.

- Side Stories: Abundant, rewarding to complete due to varied loot BUT, redundant they get. They usually are fetch quest followed by escorting whomever or clear X place.

- Game Mechanics: As with each new Fallout game that comes out, they get better and better. HOWEVER, beth vibe coders sure do be vibing when they writing cause if you mess with the internal values of, lets say the field of view; BOY the game can become wonky/do 1+1=3 or 1+1=0 type stuff (relatable tbh, like I'm it fr *_*)

- Graphics: Love them, especially the lighting.

- Game Physics: can be summed up by ""Great in general, served with a side of Jank, *Bethesda Jank*™""

- Fun to be had: Much.

200984716,english,"Fallout 4 is definitely an interesting title to review for me as if you had asked me about it when I just finished my complete playthrough for it I would have easily not recommended it. Why? For the most part of my 225 hours of experience with the game I was not affected by that many issues like bugs or crashes, but for whatever reason in the last 20 or so hours I spent finishing the final dlc in my playthrough, I faced every bug and glitch that has been the game since the launch of the dlc in 2016. This absolutely ruined my experienced at the end of my playthrough. I am writing this review after a few months to look at the game in general from a fairer perspective which is why I have recommended it in the first place.

Fallout 4 innovates from the previous titles in terms of its gun play and combat getting major overhaul with guns that have a punch to them and unique weapons that are wacky but actually useful. The perks and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats getting an overhaul with how skill checks work provided more ways to build a character to your liking. While all this is improved upon, the story of the main game takes a major toll with no longer having serious consequences, basically just oversimplifying some of the major rpg elements that the previous games in the series where able to provide.

One thing that I would like to address about the game is it tries to do so many things and ends up making those things annoying to say the least. The settlement system is a good example of this as at first look it looks overly detailed and well thought out but the longer you spend trying to work with it, you will see all its issues. Because of the game’s original release on older gen system and their lower specs there is a limitation on how many items you can build in a settlement these include farm and beds like essentials and all the non-essential decor items. Even though the game’s had a next gen patch and have been released on newer consoles it still has this limit when the newer hardware is being capable of easily rendering much more items. If want to build a good-looking settlement what you will do is often use the item deletion glitch in the settlement to go over the limit of placeable objects. Another example is the loading screens, every time you go inside a building with a door or fast travel you sit at a loading screen for 4-5 seconds. And yes, it is regardless of how modern or strong your rig is you will have to wait for loading screen. It was the same for Fallout 3 & New Vegas but at least in those if you were playing on a modern system the load screen was instant. This sounds like a minor nitpick but these load screens will add up over the course of your playthrough whether you play for 10 hours or 100 hours.

On my final word about the game is it doesn’t always work the way that it’s supposed to but the bugs & glitches sure do. Then why do I recommend it, all the criticisms that I give the game is because of how good the game can be if Bethesda actually tests these systems instead of spending their time in the creation club. While I don’t touch on the store too much in this review as this was one of the older game releases thus the creation club items are just mediocre cosmetics and two or three overpowered weapon packs from Doom & Skyrim, which are not needed to play the game unlike 76. A normal player that just plays the quests and dlc is not going to find the experience of Fallout 4 bad. I played over 200 hours exploring most if not all of the main story and dlc map locations marked or unmarked without doing any glitches and thus stumbled on all the places that the game falls short or tries to do a lot and end up achieving very little. If you are fine with an okayish Bethesda rpg set in a fallout setting you can give this game a try.",1753791061,1753791061,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,False,76561198811172166,480,18,13555,0,13555,1740513779,

- Gameplay can be good
- Characters are extremelly well written and acted
- Some aspects of the HISTORY are BAD, and it undermines the journey
- Id hated most of the game's guns designs
- Fun exploration / big open-world

After hours of troubleshooting and messing with graphics, the game started running well and the gameplay really delivers. Part of me wonders if the game is so poorly optimized to inflate hours but the game have so much content that i almost sure its partial incompetence.

This games really shines on it's ""gamplay-loop"". If you like collecting trash like a goblin this is perfect for it. You collect stuff to build and craft but it's not like the other girls, this one good.

Without spoiling much the game have a pretty bad and unsatisfying final act and conclusion. The setting, the world-build and the atmosphere do the heavy lifting, but these aspects of the written story will highly drag down the whole experience.[spoiler]The whole end-faction mystery are played too simple and under-explained that it comes out as pure lazyness and incompetence.[/spoiler] It's not everything is bad, the characters are awesome, even after years after playing i can remember all companions names, and the start/middle of the journey is decent. 

Unfortunately to a big extent the game needs mods to be truly n trough enjoyed. The mod comunity is very strong and filled with extremely talented ppl, the fan guns are awesome; also fixing a multi-bi company product for free must be tough.",1753766652,1753777589,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,False,76561198092513804,253,55,73348,0,73348,1695599327,
